# PowerBI-Tweet-Insights
This repository contains five Power BI report files (`.pbix`) created to answer specific analytical questions involving advanced filtering, time-based conditions, and interactive visualizations. Each file corresponds to a particular task: 
(1) a pie chart showing the proportion of total clicks (URL, profile, hashtag) for tweets with more than 500 impressions.
(2) a scatter chart analyzing media engagements versus media views for tweets with over 10 replies and engagement rates above 5%. 
(3) a clustered bar chart breaking down different click types by tweet category for tweets meeting certain interaction and word count thresholds.
(4) a comparison of engagement rates for tweets with versus without app opens under strict time, date, and text constraints.
(5) a visualization comparing replies, retweets, and likes for tweets exceeding median media engagements with additional filters on dates, counts, and excluded words. 
Due to the strict conditions—such as specific posting times, odd/even date checks, word count minimums, and exclusion of tweets containing certain letters—some reports may not display any results if no dataset values match the criteria. All reports were developed in Power BI Desktop using the original dataset, and they are best explored by opening the `.pbix` files directly in the application.
