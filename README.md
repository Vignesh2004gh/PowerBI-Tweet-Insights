# PowerBI-Tweet-Insights

This repository contains five Power BI report files (`.pbix`) created to address specific analytical questions with strict filtering conditions such as fixed time ranges, odd/even date checks, minimum word counts, engagement thresholds, and exclusion of certain words. Each file corresponds to one task: 


(1) a pie chart showing the proportion of total clicks (URL, profile, hashtag) for tweets with more than 500 impressions.


(2) a scatter chart analyzing media engagements versus media views for tweets with over 10 replies and an engagement rate above 5%.


(3) a clustered bar chart breaking down click types by tweet category for tweets meeting set interaction and word count limits.


(4) a comparison of engagement rates for tweets with versus without app opens under specific time, date, and text rules.


(5)a visualization comparing replies, retweets, and likes for tweets exceeding median media engagements with additional date and content filters. 


**In some cases, the dataset did not meet the given conditions, which means certain diagrams or visuals may not appear in the reports. All reports were created in Power BI Desktop using the provided dataset and should be viewed by opening the `.pbix` files directly.The dataset used here was provided during the training process.**
